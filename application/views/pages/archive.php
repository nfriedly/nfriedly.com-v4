<h2>Gmail Proxy</h2>
<p><a href="/gmail/">http://nfriedly.com/gmail</a></p>
<p>This is my hosted copy of <a href="http://gmail-lite.sourceforge.net/">Gmail Lite</a>. At this point, it's kind of hacked into working. It's used regularly by a few folks who cannot access the main gmail website due to corpirate firewalls and the like.</p>
