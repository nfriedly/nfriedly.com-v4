<h1><img src="/img/got-ram.jpg" alt="" class="right" />Looking for that amazing $3/month hosting deal?</h1>


<h2>Sorry... It's not available anymore.</h2>

<p>The reason for the change is so that I can focus on my <a href="/quote">Web Development</a> business. If you're looking into getting a website, I can help you with every step of the way, including finding adequate hosting.</p>

<p>Existing customers have nothing to worry about, I am not canceling any old contracts.</p>

<h2>I recommend dreamiest</h2>

I currently use <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?225072">dreamhost</a> for my websites and I recommend them for most of my clients. They have solid, feature-packed servers and competitive prices.</p>
