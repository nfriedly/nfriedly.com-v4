<p><img src="http://www.sxc.hu/pic/m/p/pn/pnijhuis/301823_coca_cola_for_you_2.jpg" class="right" alt="" />
Pay Per Click (PPC) ads can be bought through networks such as <b>Google Ad Sense</b>, Yahoo Overture, Microsoft, and others. </p>

<p>You can also get highly target advertising through <b>Facebook</b> and other services as well as directly with websites that have very targeted user bases. These are great methods of building brand recognition and rapidly attract visitors to your website.</p> 

<p>Using skilled keyword selection and clever copywriting, we can make sure that your ads grab attention like no other. Negative keywords and other advanced methods can help ensure that your ads only appear to interested users. This gives you a better <abbr title="Return on Investment">ROI</abbr> by having higher click through ratios.</p>

<h2>Search Engine Optimization - How to get a good ranking on Google</h2>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is perhaps the most vital part of advertising a website. It takes more time to show results, but the results continue to last long after you end the campaign.  By building a site that is friendly to both people and search engines, you receive a steady stream of free traffic for as long as your site lasts.</p>

<p>Basic SEO is included with all site developed by nFriedly in the form of <b>search engine friendly urls or "pretty urls"</b> and <b>clean HTML code</b>.</p>

<h2>Viral Marketing - People Focused</h2>
<p>Viral marketing, when done right, can achieve better results than PPC advertising for a fraction of the costs. Similar to SEO, it may take time to really show results. You may also have to keep at it. However, the increased traffic it brings is well worth the trouble.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Blogging</h2>
<p>Websites can see nearly 100 fold increases in traffic after a blog is launched in conjunction with viral marketing.  Blogging helps to establish your site as an authority in whatever niche it occupies and gives the search engines a landing page to send interested users to. </p>
<p>If you're not a fan of writing, professional writers can be brought to help with the content.</p>

<h2>A/B & Multivariate testing</h2>
<p>A/B testing can be used on any site to see which version of something users prefer. On sites with significant traffic, its bigger brother, Multivariate testing, can be brought in to fine tune every aspect of the site to help you get the most out of it.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
