		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right David, either one of these techniques could be used on it&#039;s own. My goals, in order, were:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Best user experience possible&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to block automated spam tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

As such, I included two contact methods, and let the user choose whichever they prefer. Both of the methods could be beaten by an even mildly competent spammer, but they&#039;re still enough to keep the majority of them at bay. 

I&#039;ll see if I can make it a little more clear though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a computer scientist who had not really done any PHP before looking at some contact forms  (including yours), to write one... but something confuses me: you put the webmaster&#039;s e-address in both the HTML/JavaScript and PHP, but you only need one, right? If the idea is to require messaging using the form, what is the reason for the &#039;clickable&#039; e-address, or can it just be omitted? If JavaScript will show it to a user, I suspect spammers will eventually try to  harvest e-addresses by having programs access that anyway, or even doing it manually, so maybe you should be clear about what these two instances of the admin e-address are for, and what reasons one may want to use one or the other or both.]]></description>

Just wanted to thank you for the great post. Very easy to understand and implement. Makes me wonder why I didn&#039;t think of this first. Again thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t get either of those errors when I ran it through the validator. (I did get a different one that I just fixed though).

Did you change the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag, by chance? Those errors do show up if I tell the validator it&#039;s an XHTML document.

In general, though, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Neither of those issues are actually problems with the page. One is just the validator incorrectly parsing JavaScript, and the other one is that it doesn&#039;t allow &lt;noscript&gt; elements in whatever Doctype you&#039;re using. However, real browsers get both of those things correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, i&#039;m using the contact form, but i f i try to validate the code using http://validator.w3.org/ i receive 3 errors. I&#039;m not expert and i ask your help

here the errors

---&gt;Line 166, Column 56: document type does not allow element &quot;a&quot; here

…t.write(&#039;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;&quot;&gt;&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;&#039;);

✉

The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed. This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a &quot;style&quot; element in the &quot;body&quot; section instead of inside &quot;head&quot; -- or two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).

One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTML&#039;s rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML&#039;s &quot;self-closing&quot; tags for &quot;meta&quot; and &quot;link&quot; in the &quot;head&quot; section of a HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the &quot;head&quot; section and the beginning of the &quot;body&quot; section (where &quot;link&quot; and &quot;meta&quot; are not allowed; hence the reported error).

--&gt;Warning Line 166, Column 79: character &quot;&lt;&quot; is the first character of a delimiter but occurred as data

…t.write(&#039;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;&quot;&gt;&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;&#039;);

✉

This message may appear in several cases:

    You tried to include the &quot;Error Line 167, Column 9: end tag for &quot;a&quot; omitted, but OMITTAG NO was specified



✉

You may have neglected to close an element, or perhaps you meant to &quot;self-close&quot; an element, that is, ending it with &quot;/&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&gt;&quot;.
Info Line 166, Column 17: start tag was here

document.write(&#039;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;&quot;&gt;&#039;+first + &#039;@&#039; + last+&#039;Error Line 168, Column 10: document type does not allow element &quot;noscript&quot; here; missing one of &quot;object&quot;, &quot;applet&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;iframe&quot;, &quot;button&quot;, &quot;ins&quot;, &quot;del&quot; start-tag

Per

✉

The mentioned element is not allowed to appear in the context in which you&#039;ve placed it; the other mentioned elements are the only ones that are both allowed there and can contain the element mentioned. This might mean that you need a containing element, or possibly that you&#039;ve forgotten to close a previous element.

One possible cause for this message is that you have attempted to put a block-level element (such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;) inside an inline element (such as &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Nathan, great work and thanks a lot for a great piece of software. I was even able to use the clickable e-mail address feature for multiple e-mail addresses on a single page. I am obviously elated about that.

I have used the script on three website so far with great success. The last one however, not so lucky. For some reason spammer are able to send spam through. Might be possible that they are filling out the form manually.

Great work anyways.
