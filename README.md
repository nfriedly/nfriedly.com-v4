Previous version of my website, preserved here for posterity. Was based on CodeIgniter with a WordPress blog and a number of other odds and ends. Website had a customer login area for to view and pay invoices. (Payment sent customer to third-party site for CC processing. On A related note, don't ever sign up with Charge.com/Pipeline Data/Secure Pay/etc. Just don't.)
